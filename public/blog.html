            For the next six months, I'm going to program everyday for a minimum of one hour. I can spend most days on a project for three or four
            hours before bedtime, but doing it everyday without pause will be a nice test.
            I've been programming off and on for about a year. During that time I've stopped for two to three months before picking it up again. My
            goal is to push through that and continue to work steadily through the end of the year.
            I wrote out a plan for what I'd like to learn over the six months. I plan to start by going over my old projects and making notes on changes for my current
            website. After a couple weeks of review, I'm moving on to learning Node. I've dabbled in Node a bit, but I don't have a solid grasp on the concepts
            and implimentation of Node. After Node, I'll move on to database learning, delve into responsive design for a website rehaul, and eventually
            find my way to React. There are many more things I plan to learn in between those things, but those are my biggest goals.
